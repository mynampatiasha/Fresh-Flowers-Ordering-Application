<h1>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRESH FLOWERS:</h1>

I must have flowers, always and always.<br>

<p>A few steps go a long way; follow ours to ensure your blooms last longer!<br>

Little water can go a long way:<br>

Although your flowers contain oasis, which keeps the flowers hydrated, sprinkling water on the flowers the next day ensures longevity of your blooms.<br>

The Sun can’t resist us but as they say too much of everything is bad:<br>

Keep the box away from direct sunlight and other forms of heat, as with excessive warmth they wilt a lot faster.<br>

Cool temperatures are bloom-friendly:<br>

The endurance of your flowers is dependent on the weather; hence, it’s best to keep them in an air-conditioned surrounding.<br>

It is after-all a Box of Love:<br>

With a bit of care and attention, your little box of love is bound to last longer</p><br>
